	#ls: list, lists alll the files or directories in any directory you specify & it helps with quickly skimming over contents instead of manually sorting them, -t sorts by modification time
	#mkdir: makes a new directory, useful for organization & for not wanting to create one physically, -p makes a parent directory
	#cp: copies a file, useful for when you need to duplicate a file or directory & can help with transferring, organizing, and backing up, -r allows you to copy directories and it's contents

	#git is a system where you can essentially track all of the changes that where made to your computer files, it saves every version you've worked on. through git you can add your work through "git add" and save it to the staging area, which you can then call "git commit" which saves it to the local repository, which you can then put on github with "git push". and github is online storage where you can save and share work. gitbash is specifically for windows as it's a tool that sllows you to run git commands, like the terminal on mac.

	#jupyter notebook is basically an interactive document that allows you write and run code with the results instantly. jupyter lab is a more complex version of jupyter notebook, allowing you to work on multiple documents, which is more useful for layered projects. 
	#vs code is a workspace that allows you to write code in a organized manner. it works with many different languages and runs the code all in the same place.
